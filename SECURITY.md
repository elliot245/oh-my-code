## Security Best Practices

When using oh-my-code, consider the following:

### Agent Security

- **File Permissions**: Ensure proper file permissions on agent configuration files
- **Agent Scripts**: Review agent scripts before running them in production
- **CLI Credentials**: Do not store API keys or tokens in agent configurations
- **Quality Gates**: Review what quality gates execute before running them

### Workflow Security

- **GitHub Access**: Ensure GitHub tokens have minimal required permissions
- **Pull Requests**: Review PRs carefully before merging
- **Scheduled Jobs**: Be aware of what commands are scheduled in crontab
- **Team Access**: Control who can modify agent configurations

### Data Protection

- **Sensitive Data**: Never commit secrets, API keys, or passwords
- **Workspace**: Keep workspace contents private if they contain sensitive information
- **Logs**: Be careful when sharing logs that might contain sensitive information

## Dependency Security

This project uses minimal dependencies:
- `python3` (standard library only)
- `tmux`

We recommend:
- Keeping your Python installation updated
- Using the latest stable version of tmux
- Regularly checking for security updates in your operating system

## Private Information

Never commit the following to the repository:

- API keys or tokens
- Passwords or credentials
- Personal information
- Private keys or certificates
- Agent credentials or access tokens

Use environment variables or secure configuration files for sensitive data.

## Agent Permissions

Agents run with the same permissions as the user who started them. Be aware that:

- Agents can read and write files within the workspace
- Agents can execute system commands
- Agents can make API calls with any credentials provided
- Review all agent scripts and tasks before execution
